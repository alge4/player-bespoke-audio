## Usage

### For Game Masters

#### Uploading Audio Files

1. Open any player character's character sheet
2. Navigate to the **Audio** tab
3. Click **Select Audio File** to choose an audio file from your computer
4. Supported formats: MP3, WAV, OGG
5. The file will be uploaded and added to the character's playlist

#### Playing Audio for Players

1. In the character sheet's **Audio** tab, click the play button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) next to any audio file
2. The audio will play only for the player who owns that character
3. Use the **Stop All** button to stop any currently playing audio

#### Managing Audio Files

- **Delete**: Click the trash icon (üóëÔ∏è) to remove an audio file from the playlist
- **Preview**: Players can preview audio files using the built-in audio controls

### For Players

#### Viewing Your Audio Files

1. Open your character sheet
2. Go to the **Audio** tab
3. You can see all audio files uploaded by your GM
4. Use the audio controls to preview files (this won't notify other players)

#### Receiving Audio

- When your GM plays an audio file for your character, you'll receive a notification
- The audio will play automatically at the volume level set in your client settings
- Only you will hear the audio - other players won't be affected

## Settings

### Module Settings

- **Enable GM Controls**: Show/hide GM control interface
- **Default Audio Volume**: Set the default volume for played audio files (0-1)

### Client Settings

- **Audio Volume**: Personal volume setting for received audio files

## File Storage

Audio files are stored in the module's data directory:

```
Data/modules/player-bespoke-audio/audio/[character-id]/
```

### Directory Structure

The module uses the following directory structure:

- `modules/player-bespoke-audio/audio/` - Main audio directory
- `modules/player-bespoke-audio/audio/[character-id]/` - Character-specific audio folders

**Note**: Foundry VTT automatically creates necessary directories when files are uploaded. The module includes fallback mechanisms to ensure uploads succeed even if the preferred path structure isn't available.

## Compatibility

- **Foundry VTT**: Version 11.0+
- **Systems**: Compatible with all game systems
- **Modules**: No known conflicts

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Not Playing

1. Check that the target player is online and connected
2. Verify the audio file format is supported (MP3, WAV, OGG)
3. Ensure the player's browser supports HTML5 audio
4. Check the module's volume settings

### File Upload Issues

1. Ensure you have GM permissions
2. Check that the file size is reasonable (< 50MB recommended)
3. Verify the file format is supported
4. Make sure you have write permissions to the Foundry data directory
5. **Directory Creation**: The module automatically creates necessary directories for audio files. If you encounter "Target directory does not exist" errors, the module will attempt to create the directory structure automatically.
6. **Fallback Upload**: If directory creation fails, the module will attempt to upload to a fallback location within the module's audio folder.

### Socket Connection Problems

1. Restart Foundry VTT
2. Check that all players are properly connected
3. Verify the module is enabled for all connected clients
